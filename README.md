## Functionality

This webppp uses jQuery and basic styling to emulate a guessing game between the User and App.  

At page load, a random Letter is chosen by the CPU.  

The users then try to guess what letter by typing, and are allotted a certain amount of guesses.  

Depending on whether the correct letter was guessed or not, the User gets a win or loss.
